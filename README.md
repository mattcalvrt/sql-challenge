# sql-challenge
This repo uses quickDBD and PostgreSQL to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis on a sample employee database. QuickDBD was used to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. The ERD and table schema was imported into PostgreSQL and data from the six CSV files was imported into the corresponding SQL table. SQL queries were then created to answer of set of questions based on the employee data.

Location of files and folders:
- Image file of the ERD: ***QuickDBD-sql-challenge.png***
- SQL file of table schema: ***QuickDBD-sql-challenge.sql***
- SQL file of queries: ***queries.sql***
- CSV files: Located in the folder ***EmployeeSQL/Starter_Code/data***
